HyperCod is an interactive platform and English-like scripting language inspired by the classic **HyperTalk**. It allows you to create complex interactions, interactive "stacks," and multimedia applications using a simple, "natural" syntax.

## 📝 What is HyperCod?

HyperCod is designed to be highly readable and accessible. Every script in HyperCod consists of **handlers** that respond to messages like clicking a button or opening a card. 

It brings the spirit of 80s/90s creative computing to the modern web, allowing you to:
*   Navigate through "Cards" in a "Stack".
*   Create interactive buttons and text fields.
*   Use "Natural Language" commands like `go to the next card` or `put "Hello" into field 1`.
*   Add visual effects like dissolves, wipes, and zooms.
*   Integrate directly with JavaScript for advanced functionality.

## 🛠 How to Use HyperCod

1.  **Launch the App**: Open [HyperCOD](https://everythingability.github.io/HyperCod/) in your browser.
2.  **Build Your UI**: Use the interface tools to add buttons, fields, and images to your cards.
3.  **Script Interactions**: Select an object (like a button) and write a script using the HyperCod Language. 
    *   *Example:* 
        ```hypertalk
        on mouseUp
          visual effect "dissolve"
          go to the next card
        end mouseUp
        ```
